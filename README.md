# CISInvoice is an application for UK Construction workes who are on the HMRC CIS (Construction Industry Scheme) to streamline the generation of invoices for the clients and for the accounts. This part so far consists of the android app which writes data to an sqlite database. The long term aims are to send the data to a server to hold data for a desktop application. The code here has been written in Android Studio, but I am contemplating on moving it over to Windev Mobile. I openly admit I have not continued with this application for some time, but I have been away working. Any assistance would be gratefully received, in ideas, code addition or changes and general development. The aim is to offer the software totally free, with ease of use a primary concern. These hard working people don't need to think hard at the end of the week to get the invoices sent.
